CMSMonolog
============

This project embeds [Monolog 1.10.x-dev](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) into CMS Made Simple.  From the Minify website:

> Monolog sends your logs to files, sockets, inboxes, databases and various web services. See the complete list of handlers below. Special handlers allow you to build advanced logging strategies.

> This library implements the PSR-3 interface that you can type-hint against in your own libraries to keep a maximum of interoperability. You can also use it in your applications to make sure you can always use another compatible logger at a later time.

For support, please submit [an issue](https://github.com/drmikecrowe/cmsms_monolog/issues) for assistance.

TARGET AUDIENCE
================

This module will benefit developers.  Standard CMSMS installations will NOT benefit from this, as standard CMSMS logs will go to Monolog.

CAUTION
========

The paint is still wet on this one, please test thoroughly before using on a live site

Feedback/constructive criticism welcome
